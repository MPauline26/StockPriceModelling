# Stock Price Modeling Project

This repository contains a Python notebook for a personal project aimed at modeling the development of stock prices. The project serves both as a means to develop coding skills and explore potential applications for future trading strategies.

## Project Overview

The project workflow consists of the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Stock data is obtained from the Yahoo Finance API.

2. **Data Exploration and Visualization**: The collected stock data is visualized through various plots. This includes plotting the stock prices, calculating and plotting daily returns, and generating candlestick charts for the past month.

3. **Model Development**: A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model is developed to predict future stock prices based on historical data.

## Dependencies

To run the Python notebook, you will need the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- mplfinance
- yfinance
- scikit-learn
- keras

## Key Dependencies

- `sklearn`: For train-test split and data preprocessing.
- `matplotlib`: For plotting stock data and candlestick charts.
- `mplfinance`: For generating candlestick charts.
- `yfinance`: For accessing stock data from Yahoo Finance.
- `pandas` and `numpy`: For data manipulation and calculations.
- `keras`: For building and training the LSTM model.
